this is my  second micro internship project
Internship Portal UI Prototype
This repository contains a responsive front-end prototype for an Internship Portal, featuring a dynamic, collapsible sidebar navigation menu and a sticky "Apply for Internship" banner. This project was developed as part of "Task 2" to demonstrate fundamental web development skills in creating intuitive and adaptive user interfaces.

Project Description
The core objective of this task was to build a user-friendly web interface that includes two key components:

Responsive Sidebar Menu: A navigation sidebar that adapts to different screen sizes. On smaller screens, it functions as a collapsible menu, accessible via a hamburger icon, sliding in and out. On larger screens, it remains persistently visible. The sidebar provides quick access to various sections of the portal.

Sticky Internship Banner: A prominent "Apply for Internship" banner that remains fixed to the top-left corner of the screen, ensuring visibility regardless of scroll position.

Features
Collapsible Sidebar Navigation:

Slides in/out on smaller screens (mobile/tablet) via a hamburger menu icon.

Always visible and static on larger screens (desktop).

Contains essential navigation links:

Internship Application

Offer Letter Generation

Certificate Verification

Team Join Form

Contact Info

Closes automatically on link click (on mobile) and on clicking outside the sidebar.

Supports keyboard accessibility (e.g., Escape key to close the sidebar).

Sticky "Apply for Internship" Banner:

Positioned fixed at the top-left of the viewport.

Remains visible even when the user scrolls down the page.

Fully Responsive Design:

Optimized for seamless viewing and interaction across all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Utilizes a mobile-first approach.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the fundamental structure of the web page.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and consistent styling, ensuring responsiveness and a modern aesthetic.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): For handling the interactive elements, including sidebar toggling, click-outside-to-close functionality, and keyboard accessibility.
